# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am software developer :seedling:

I have always been fascinated by the fact that everyone is able to create something new while using something so simple as a computer. 
Whether it involves crafting web applications, designing engaging video games, or various manual task automation, the inherent power of technology is at the heart of this creative process.
What's so great is that anyone can get in on this creative action.

I have fond heart for programming, and I like to work on projects that make life easier or happier for people. Right now, I focus on programming, I excel in C# and the .NET platform, 
crafting versatile applications for multiple operating systems. Proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, CSS, and HTML, I design responsive, user-centric web interfaces. 
My SQL expertise ensures effective database management and data-driven application development.

## Overview of some of my projects :seedling:

:arrow_right: [Scooter Rental](https://github.com/LigaV123/Scooter_Rental) with Unit Testing (also using Moq) to make scooter service with workable rental options and income calculations.

:arrow_right: [Flight Planner](https://github.com/LigaV123/Flight_Planner) where HTTP & Web API basics were used to save data in a database using entity framework to manage available flights in airports (add and remove as needed) as administrator, and as clients to be able to find required flights.

:arrow_right: Employee Management with Unit Testing (also using Moq) to manage employee work contracts, calculate worked hours and their salary (still in progress).
